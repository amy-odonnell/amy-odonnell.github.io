I'm Amy O'Donnell ‚Äî a digital inclusion and online safety specialist with a deep commitment to ethical and impactful technology.

I‚Äôve spent over a decade working at the intersection of social change, community empowerment, and digital innovation. Whether supporting grassroots organisations to navigate the online world safely or advising on policy frameworks that promote responsible tech development, my focus is on ensuring no one is left behind in our digital future.

### What I Do

- **Digital Inclusion**: Championing equitable access to technology, especially for underrepresented and vulnerable communities.
- **Online Safety**: Supporting individuals and organisations to build safer online environments.
- **Ethical Tech**: Advising on responsible, rights-based approaches to technology design and deployment.
- **Storytelling for Change**: Elevating voices and narratives that inspire action and drive digital rights forward.

### Core Values

- üå± **Empowerment over extraction**  
- ü§ù **Collaboration over competition**  
- üåç **Impact over hype**

### Why It Matters

Technology has enormous potential to improve lives ‚Äî but only if it's built and implemented with care, inclusivity, and integrity. I work with organisations, funders, and developers to put people at the centre of digital transformation.
