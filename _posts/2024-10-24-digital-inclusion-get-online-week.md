Nominet's ongoing efforts to maintain .UK as a critical part of our national infrastructure highlights just how important the internet is for everyone's security, wellbeing, and safety. Yet, opening the news on your phone, watching a video to learn a skill or applying for a job online isn't a given for everyone in the UK. This year's [Get Online Week](https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org/discover/get-online-week) provides an important opportunity to raise awareness about the resources available to help individuals not only get connected, but also feel secure and confident online.

Since 2007, Good Things Foundation's annual campaign has helped tens of thousands of people boost their digital skills and confidence. This year, over 1,000 free community events across the UK will offer support to people facing digital exclusion.

Digital inclusion is more than just having access to the internet; it's about how we engage with society. According to Good Things Foundation, [more than a quarter](https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org/discover/our-news/our-news-2024/polling-reveals-low-digital-confidence) (26%) of people lack confidence when it comes to using the internet to compete for jobs. This matters because solving the issue of digital exclusion requires more than access to devices and connectivity -- it's about understanding how people interact with the digital world. As our online and offline lives blend, it's essential to ensure everyone can fully participate in society.

One starting point is to zoom in on first introductions. Having access to tech at an early age is a privilege that opens up future opportunities and is deeply linked with modern education. According to our [2023 Digital Youth Index](https://digitalyouthindex.uk/), around 2 million young people in the UK don't have access to a learning device at home, limiting their ability to engage in self-directed learning. 15% of all young people lack broadband access at home. This figure rises to 23% among those receiving free school meals, highlighting disparities based on socioeconomic status. By working together to bridge these gaps, we can create a more inclusive digital world where everyone can thrive.

Meanwhile, we found that half of young people teach themselves digital skills. Though inspiring, if they have limited access at home, time pressures can hamper their learning. This can create a cycle where those without skills struggle to get ahead, deepening existing inequalities.

The Minimum Digital Standard of Living (MDLS), developed by the University of Liverpool in collaboration with the Good Things Foundation, provides a clearer picture of the issue. This benchmark was created through public consultation to determine what people feel is necessary to be digitally included. It's concerning that [40% of UK households](https://mdls.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MDLS-final-report-v1.11-1.pdf) with children fall below this standard, highlighting the urgent need to address these inequalities so that no one is left behind.

To build a more inclusive digital future, it's essential to equip individuals with the skills needed for their careers. Those who possess digital competencies will shape the future of our society, creating a positive cycle of opportunity and growth.

This year's Get Online Week is a fantastic reminder of the support available to help individuals connect, learn, and thrive in an increasingly digital world -- levelling the playing field for everyone.

Nominet's partnership with Good Things Foundation enables us to offer practical support and resources so that everyone, regardless of their background, can access the internet safely and confidently. Together, we can work towards a future where digital inclusion is the norm, not the exception.
